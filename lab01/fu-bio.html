        My name is Yujia Fu. My current major is Information Management and Technology. What interests me about it is that if I want to become a librarian, I must know how to work with data. Iâ€™ve interned at an art museum before, and my skills include organization and familiarity with Microsoft SQL Server. I am from New York City, I have two siblings, and my hobbies include reading, drawing, and listening to music. Thanks for reading!
