        <h1>Yujia Fu's Biography</h1>
            <p>My name is Yujia Fu. My current major is Information Management and Technology. What interests me about it is that if I want to become a librarian, I must know how to work with data. I have previously interned at an art museum, and my skills include organization and familiarity with Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
