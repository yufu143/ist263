        <img src="faq.JPG" alt="Banner that reads 'FAQ'">

            <h3>Do I have to pay for a library card?</h3>
                <p>All Declan County Public Library cards are free. There will never be any payment required.</p>    
            <h3>I'm new to this and I'm not sure how to get a library card.</h3>
                <p>For new patrons, there will be an application on our website, or you can go into any Declan County Public Library branch and speak to one of the librarians about getting one. Children must be older than 5 to be able to apply and will preferably be accompanied by a parent or guardian. For adults, an identification card as well as mailing address are required to be presented during the application process.</p>
            <h3>How do I return borrowed books?</h3>
                <p>The map of the library layout can be found on our information page. When you come in through the entrance, to your left, you will see the doorway to the West Room. When you walk in, the Drop-Off and Checkout stations will be lined up on the left wall. For other branches, you can always ask the librarians on duty for assistance.</p>
            <h3>Will I be charged a late fee if my books are overdue?</h3>
                <p>The Declan County Public Library does not charge patrons for overdue books, but a replacement fee for lost material(s) is required. For overdue holds, you are urged to drop them off at any branch as soon as possible.</p>
            <h3>Are the libraries open all week?</h3>
                <p>Hours vary from branch to branch, but they are open every day of the week except Sunday.</p>

        <img src="qa.JPG" alt="Banner that reads 'Q&A'">

            <h3>When are you open?</h3>
                <p>Our opening hours can be found on our information page under General Information.</p>
            <h3>I'm a student and I'm looking for volunteering and internship opportunities. Is your branch going to be having any?</h3>
                <p>As we are a recently opened branch, we don't have any currently available programs. However, we are setting up an after-school tutoring program with Nelson Park High for K-12 children that will start in March. If you're interested, you can contact us through our email, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. If not, you can sign up for the Declan County Public Library newsletter which will notify you when new volunteering and internship opportunities are available at our branch or others.</p>
            <h3>Are the bathrooms open to the public?</h3>
                <p>Yes, all our facilities are open to the general public.</p>
            <h3>Is food or drink allowed?</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, food and drink are not allowed, but these rules are flexible. Liquids in closed-lid containers are acceptable. No alcoholic beverages are allowed inside under any circumstance. No food is allowed to be eaten on the first or second floor, but there is a lounge in the basement, you can bring food into if it's a must.</p>
