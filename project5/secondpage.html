        <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>

            <h3>Do I have to pay for a library card?</h3>

            <h3>I'm new to this and I'm not sure how to get a library card.</h3>

Children must be older than 5 to be able to apply and will preferably be accompanied by a parent or guardian. For adults, an identification card as well as mailing address are required to be presented during the application process.</p>
            <h3>How do I return borrowed books?</h3>
                <p>The map of the library layout can be found on our information page. When you come in through the entrance, to your left, you will see the doorway to the West Room. When you walk in, the Drop-Off and Checkout stations will be lined up on the left wall. For other branches, you can always ask the librarians on duty for assistance.</p>
            <h3>Will I be charged a late fee if my books are overdue?</h3>
                <p>The Declan County Public Library does not charge patrons for overdue books, but a replacement fee for lost material(s) is required. For overdue holds, you are urged to drop them off at any branch as soon as possible.</p>
            <h3>Are the libraries open all week?</h3>
                <p>Hours vary from branch to branch, but they are open every day of the week except Sunday.</p>
